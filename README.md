# Archi Groovy Scripting Plug-in

## What is this?

__Notice__ : This plugin is a free adaptation of the very good [jArchi](https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-scripting-plugin) module and provide the same functionnatity and more with Groovy Scripting. Tanks a lot to the authors of this module and their advices.

__Version 1.0.0__

This is an extension to Archi that allows scripting using the Groovy language. The Archi Groovy scripting API has access to the components of an Archi model so that you can construct your own tasks and queries to achieve things that you might not be able to do easily via the user interface. For example you could write an Archi Groovy script to:

    Generate reports
    Create heat maps
    Import and export to and from different formats
    Query models
    Quickly replace or merge concepts
    Find and remove redundant elements
    Batch processing

Archi Groovy help you to manage JARs dependency for your script. All the Java ecosystem is on your hands. See the dependency section to know more.

You can use your favorite IDE to edit and control version for your script. Archi Groovy Scripting was successfuly tested with Eclispe and IntelliJ IDEA.

Archi Groovy users can share their scripts and learn from each other, see here for some shared scripts.
